# How to Bioinformatics

Contained within this repo is some information about the Djordjevic Genomics Lab, what we do and why we think its important. It also contains some links to videos and other resources that should help in your quest toward Bioinformatic prowess!

I hope you find it useful...


# Background and Context


Currently we undertake microbial genetic epidemiological investigations that aim to elucidate the genetic characteristics and phylogenetic structure of microbial populations from agricultural, clinical and environmental settings. We have short-read sequence data on around a thousand or so E. coli isolates, and this number is growing fast. We also are expanding into other microbial Genera, such as Klebsiella and Proteus.


Such investigations are important because it is increasingly recognised that animal, human and environmental microbiota are in a state of flux - many mechanisms allow for the transfer of bacteria and other microbes between these different contexts, and because of this, human, animal and evironmental health are intrinsically linked. This concept is referred as the One Health Initiative; a framework or lens through which one can approach investigations that involve the study, treatment and prevention of infectious disease. According to the One Health Initiative's webpage:



> *The One Health Initiative is a movement to forge co-equal, all inclusive collaborations between physicians, osteopathic physicians,
> veterinarians, dentists, nurses and other scientific-health and environmentally related disciplines.*
